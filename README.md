# medicc2-pipeline

Installing additional dependencies
From within the repository directory, run the install_env.sh script to generate a conda environment and install custom packages:
```
./install_env.sh $HOME/miniconda/

```
If you used a previously installed conda build please use the conda or miniconda installation directory when running this section instead of '$HOME/miniconda/' to correctly initialise the conda environment.

```
 conda activate medicc2
```
